# Cross platform Typescript Game Engine targeted at Ionic Framework

## Purpose

Ionic Framework is great for making cross platform apps, but it is rarely used for games. The purpose of this package is to provide a comprehensive ECS game engine that easily plugs into Ionic Framework and renders to a HTML Canvas.

## Design

IonGame is an is built using an ECS framework to give game developers a lot of flexibility over traditional inheritance based frameworks. IonGame uses standard Web APIs like Canvas and WebAudio to provide cross platform support.
